                            <h3>A Brief History...</h3>
                            <p>Danny Allen founded NuTech in 1989. Danny, a 1980 graduate of the University of
                                Houston College of Pharmacy, recognized an opportunity to fill a vital need in
                                the East Texas healthcare marketplace while working for a national nuclear
                                pharmacy chain in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area. With commitments from a
                                few hospitals in the Tyler/Longview area, he and his wife, Georganne, opened the
                                business in a small, leased space in an office building, and delivered the first
                                radiopharmaceutical doses in August of 1989. Since then, the company has grown
                                steadily, adding additional pharmacists and support personnel, and moving into a
                                new, state-of-the-art building in 1993. </p>
                            <h4> Expansion Into New Markets</h4>
                            <p>NuTech's service area expanded in April of 1999 when Danny opened a new pharmacy
                                in College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&M University. NuTech expanded again
                                in 2005 with the opening of our Wichita Falls, Texas pharmacy. From these three
                                pharmacies, NuTech serves most of East Texas, North Central Texas and Southern
                                Oklahoma.</p>
                            <h4>Our Commitment</h4>
                            <p>Today, NuTech is proud of its record of superior customer service,
                                professionalism, and safety, and grateful for the loyalty shown by its
                                customers. NuTech is committed to continuing and improving upon these qualities
                                which have allowed for its success, and to continuing to offer its customers the
                                very best in radiopharmaceuticals and related nuclear pharmacy products and
                                services.</p>
